The release files have been signed with the OpenPGP key of Tormod Volden
and can be verified against the public key ID:
C68187379B23DE9EFC46651E2C80FF56C6830A0E.
Its fingerprint is:
C681 8737 9B23 DE9E FC46  651E 2C80 FF56 C683 0A0E

The key is included in the file KEYS from <https://github.com/libusb/libusb/blob/master/KEYS>

Add the release manager keys with:
	gpg --import KEYS

After import, it can be checked against multiple key servers:

	gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys C68187379B23DE9EFC46651E2C80FF56C6830A0E 
	gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C68187379B23DE9EFC46651E2C80FF56C6830A0E 

The release files can then be verified with e.g.
	gpg --verify libusb-1.0.27.tar.bz2.asc
